						As a company duly registered by law, Bouk, including any of its
						wholly owned subsidiary, provides an online market platform, which
						uses internet, web-based and mobile application technology to create
						an online forum where you can interact with other users, merchants,
						food places and/or other businesses and independent or private
						delivery contractors (“Contractors”). Bouk’s platform (the
						“Software”) grants users/customers the permission to request
						delivery pick-ups, drop-offs, and send request for different items,
						food and/or other goods from numerous places, namely, shops,
						residential addresses, restaurants and businesses, either for
						delivery pickup or drop-off. Soon as a request is made, the Software
						alerts Contractors that a delivery pick-up or drop-off opportunity
						is open, and the Software expedite execution of the request to the
						customer. The moment a pickup order is made, the Software
						communicates with the customer regarding the order for pickup.
						Kindly note that Bouk is neither a cafeteria, delivery company, or
						commercial kitchen company, nor is it a courier, shipping provider,
						common carrier, or food service provider. Meals, groceries, drinks,
						and other things brought to you are not provided by Bouk.
						Boukers/drivers are not our personnel, partners, or agents.

								Arbitrator Powers.
								<span className='p'>
									Any conflict regarding the interpretation, validity,
									recognition and enforcement, or establishment of this
									Arbitration Agreement shall be resolved solely by the
									arbitrator, not by court at different levels or institution,
									including, but not restricted to, any assertion that some or
									all sections of this Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable.
									All disagreements over the fees of arbitrator, including the
									scheduling of such fees and sanctions for lack of payment,
									must be resolved by an arbitrator rather than a law court. The
									arbitration shall determine user and Bouk's rights and
									responsibilities, if any. The arbitration action cannot be
									merged with other cases or added with any other hearings or
									parties unless explicitly allowed in paragraph 13(g) of this
									Agreement. The arbitrator will be able to accept petitions
									that will resolve all or some part of any allegation or
									disagreement. The arbitrator has the power to grant financial
									compensation and non-money related solution or remedies
									applicable to a person within relevant laws, the procedures of
									the arbitration venue, and this Agreement on a case-by-case
									basis (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator
									shall produce a formal report of ruling outlining the key
									observations and results that shall be used to make any
									judgment (or discretion not to make an award), as well as the
									compensation granted. The verdict is exclusively enforceable
									between the parties and has no bearing on any subsequent
									arbitration or other procedure involving a separate party. The
									arbitrator must adhere to all relevant laws. The arbitrator
									has similar ability as a judge in a law court to grant relief
									on a case-by-case basis. The ruling of the arbitrator is
									binding on both parties.
