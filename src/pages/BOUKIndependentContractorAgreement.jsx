          BOUK is a duly and legally registered company that provides a delivery
          pick-up and drop-off services and an online marketplace platform using
          web-based and mobile application technology that connects
          drivers/boukers/contractors, and other businesses, and consumers (“BOUK
          platform” or “platform”). BOUK’s software permits registered users to
          request delivery pick-up, drop-off, and place orders for goods from
          numerous businesses. BOUK software alerts drivers/boukers that a delivery
          or pick-up request is available once such orders are placed, and BOUK
          software supports delivery accomplishment. BOUK is neither an eatery, a
          meal courier service, or a food preparatory company.

          certifies that he or she or they have all required apparatus and personnel
          to complete the delivery and any other services envisaged by this

          and the method by which those requests are fulfilled; (ii) they are
          unrestricted in choosing when they want to be accessible to start

                  This Mutual Arbitration Agreement covers disputes between the
                  CONTRACTOR and any BOUK affiliates, subsidiaries, successors,
                  agents, and employees that generate from or associated with this
                  Agreement but is not applicable to any claims that cannot be
                  arbitrated under applicable law. To the extent the parties have
                  both arbitrable and non-arbitrable disputes that are related, the
                  arbitrable disputes shall proceed first in arbitration and the
                  non-arbitrable disputes shall be stayed, and any applicable
                  statutes of limitations tolled, pending completion of the
                  arbitration. Even if the CONTRACTOR and/or BOUK are excluded from
                  the FAA, the parties outrightly accept that the FAA will define
                  this Agreement. Any disagreements over the FAA's applicability
                  will be decided by an independent arbitrator. The state law
                  regulating arbitration clauses in the state where the CONTRACTOR
                  works will govern if the FAA does not apply for whatever reason.

                  The Parties accept candidly that unofficial attempts to settle
                  conflicts can often lead to quick, minimal, and mutually
                  satisfactory conclusion, and thus agree that, before any party
                  seeks arbitral proceedings against the other, private dialogue to
                  find casual approaches of resolution in good faith via
                  videoconferencing or phone conversation must first be held. The
                  initiating party shall give the other notice in writing of the
                  intended informal meeting, either by themselves or through a
                  counsel and the meeting shall hold

                  45 days after the other party receives such notice, except there
                  is mutually agreed upon extension of time. The notice may be done
                  by the official email addresses or any other convenient means of
                  record. In the meantime, statute of limitations and other related
                  laws shall be tolled until the informal process is completed.

                  If the unofficial procedure fails to resolve the disagreement
                  amongst the parties and either party wishes to pursue arbitration,
                  the originating party must give a notice in letter inside the
                  relevant statute of limitations timeframe via registered mail,
                  return postage desired, or delivered by hand. This request for
                  arbitration should include (1) the party requesting
                  arbitration's contact details, including name and address (2)
                  an explanation of the claims regarding legal and factual grounds,

                  party must be addressed to the attorney who served the other in
